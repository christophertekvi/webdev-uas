        MakanYuk is a catering company founded by four college students in 2021. It all started when a lot of their friends kept on saying they are missing their mother's cooking.
        These four college students then started designing the company. The name MakanYuk is actually two words, "Makan" and "Yuk", which is Indonesian for "Let's eat".
        <br><br>MakanYuk specializes on home-cooked meals using the pre-order system. The menus are all scheduled so everyday there will be some meals that are different.
        This is one of the efforts made so that every meal can stay fresh and well-made. This is also to help the customers to make easier decisions and to minimalize boredom towards the menus.
